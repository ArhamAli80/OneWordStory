            <p>Introducing the One Word Story Game!
                <br>
                The One Word Story Game is an interactive experience where you can create unique stories with just a single word. Here's how it works:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Input a word: Start by entering a word of your choice into the input box. This word will serve as the starting point for your story.</li><br>
                <li>Generate the story: Once you've entered the word, the story generation algorithm, powered by the incredible language model ChatGPT, will work its magic. It will generate a sequence of three words based on the input word, continuing the story in an intriguing and unexpected way.</li><br>
                <li>Repeat until a story is complete: After each generation, you'll be presented with the three-word continuation of the story. You can choose to either continue the story by using the last word generated as the new input or stop whenever you feel satisfied with the story's progression.</li>
            </ul>    
            <p>If you're ever stuck for words or seeking inspiration, be sure to visit the Corpus page. There, you'll find a collection of words and phrases that can spark your creativity and help you come up with interesting inputs for the One Word Story Game.</p><br>    
            <p>It's important to note that the data used to create the One Word Story Game comes from ChatGPT, an AI language model trained on a diverse range of texts. The model has learned to generate creative and imaginative stories, making each experience unique and unpredictable.</p>
